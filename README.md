# Vehicle-Detection-System
Created a vehicle detection system using YOLO v2 for an autonomous driverless car. 
Used an image pre-trained network for specifying the detected vehicles with bounding boxes. Generated code to measure the distance between the driverless car and the car in front relative to the position of the camera. Trained the system using a video captured with a driverless car unit to ensure the system can be integrated into any autonomous driverless car.
